Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the clean [even](https://github.com/getzola/even) theme.

<!-- more -->

## Why Zola?

Zola is a fast static site generator written in Rust. It's simple to use, has no dependencies, and is incredibly fast at building sites.

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing my thoughts on:

- Software development
- Technology and tools
- Personal projects
- And more!

## Code Example

Here's a simple example to show off the syntax highlighting:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
